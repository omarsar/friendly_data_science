### [Episode 0 - Introduction to Friendly Data Science](https://goo.gl/Fj5Mme)
**Synopsis:** Hello everyone, I am elvis, this is a trailer or sort of an introductory video of a new YouTube series I am working on. The series is called "Friendly Data Science". As the name implies, the main goal of the series is to teach both students and practioners how to put the "you" in Data Science. By data science I am referring to fields such as machine learning, text mining, data mining, natural language processing, deep learning, and many other related fields. From what's been said, machines are said to replace the human workforce in the next coming decade. In this series I will explain to you why this may not be the case. In fact, this whole series focuses on how to take a humanistic approach in teaching machines how to think like humans. This involves imparting on machines ethical values and our common understanding of the world. I will explain in depth what I mean by these ideas as I go through the presentation.

### [Episode 1 - What is a Tensor? (Part 1)](https://youtu.be/WdDVXMOQMss)
**Synopsis:** Synopsis: Hi everyone, welcome back to the "Friendly Data Science" series. Today we are going to discuss "What is a Tensor?" I will answer this question in two parts. In this video, part 1, we discuss the theoretical aspect of a tensor. In the second part, we are going to understand tensor in the context of a programming environment. So, let us get started with part 1. The motivation behind this video is that I believe that before delving into any programming exercises or any mathematical explanation or definition of any particular concept, it is important to understand the basic units that are used in some of the most sophisticated computer science algorithms today. As programmers or analysts, we tend to ignore or simply avoid the need to understand certain rationales and characteristics of data and its structure, just because they seem unimportant or too complex. The bigger truth is that we make use of these concepts every day, so they should be important to our understanding of the world and the things we interact with. In this video, the main goal is to inspire a deeper understanding of the building blocks that enable effective data science today. One of those key concepts is the so-called tensor. In the next couple of minutes, we will go deeper into understanding what is a tensor, specifically as it relates to computer science and how it is used for machine learning and data representation.

### [Episode 1 - What is a Tensor? (Part 2)](https://youtu.be/hCSjWCVrphc)
**Synopsis:** In this notebook we will continue from where we left off in [Part 1](https://youtu.be/WdDVXMOQMss) of "What is a Tensor?". The main goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how to construct and use **scalars**, **vectors**, **matrices**, and eventually **tensors** of different dimensions. The tools used in this notebook are Python and Numpy. In addition, we will begin to introduce some notations, which will become useful for future programming sessions.
